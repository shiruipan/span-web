### Introduction
Recent years have witnessed the release of many open-source and enterprise-driven knowledge
graphs with a dramatic increase of applications of knowledge representation and reasoning in
fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. With those
large-scale knowledge graphs, recent research tends to incorporate human knowledge and
imitate humanâ€™s ability of relational reasoning. Factual knowledge stored in knowledge bases
or knowledge graphs can be utilized as a source for logical reasoning and, hence, be integrated
to improve real-world applications.

Emerging embedding-based methods for knowledge graph representation have shown their
ability to capture relational facts and model different scenarios with heterogenous information.
By combining symbolic reasoning methods or Bayesian models, deep representation learning
techniques on knowledge graphs attempt to handle complex reasoning with relational path and
symbolic logic and capture the uncertainty with probabilistic inference. Furthermore, efficient
representation learning and reasoning can be one of the paths towards the emulation of highlevel cognition and human-level intelligence. Knowledge graphs can also be seen as a means
to tackle the problem of explainability in AI. These trends naturally facilitate relevant
downstream applications which inject structural knowledge into wide-applied neural
architectures such as attention-based transformers and graph neural networks.

This special issue focuses on emerging techniques and trendy applications of knowledge graph
representation learning and reasoning in fields such as natural language processing, computer
vision, bioinformatics, and more.
