### Requirements for Monash Students

For PhD Applicant, I normally take students who have worked with me for a couple of months (e.g., through minor/honour thesis). So it would be better if you can contact me a couple of months before to express your interest. Also, you may probably require to

* have an H1 WAIM score for your Master or Honour degree. 
* have taken core data science units (e.g., FIT5201, FIT5202, FIT5197, FIT5212, FIT5149)
* have done or been doing a minor thesis related to data science.

For minor/honour thesis applicants, you will require to

* have an H1 WAIM score (>85)
* have considered doing a PhD after minor thesis.
You will probably work with one of my PhD student who can provide consistent help for your minor thesis.
