abstract: "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive success in many graph related analytics tasks. However, most GCNs only work in a single domain (graph) incapable of transferring knowledge from/to other domains (graphs), due to the challenges in both graph representation learning and domain adaptation over graph structures. In this paper, we present a novel approach, unsupervised domain adaptive graph convolutional networks (UDA-GCN), for domain adaptation learning for graphs. To enable effective graph representation learning, we first develop a dual graph convolutional network component, which jointly exploits local and global consistency for feature aggregation. An attention mechanism is further used to produce a unified representation for each node in different graphs. To facilitate knowledge transfer between graphs, we propose a domain adaptive learning module to optimize three different loss functions, namely source classifier loss, domain classifier loss, and target classifier loss as a whole, thus our model can differentiate class labels in the source domain, samples from different domains, the class labels from the target domain, respectively. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the node classification task validate the performance of our method, compared to state-of-the-art graph neural network algorithms."
