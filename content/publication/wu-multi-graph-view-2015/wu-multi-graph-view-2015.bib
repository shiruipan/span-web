 abstract = {Graph classification has traditionally focused on graphs generated from a single feature view. In many applications, it is common to have useful information from different channels/views to describe objects, which naturally results in a new representation with multiple graphs generated from different feature views being used to describe one object. In this paper, we formulate a new Multi-Graph-View learning task for graph classification, where each object to be classified contains graphs from multiple graph-views. This problem setting is essentially different from traditional single-graph-view graph classification, where graphs are from one single feature view. To solve the problem, we propose a Cross Graph-View Sub graph Feature based Learning (gCGVFL) algorithm that explores an optimal set of sub graphs, across multiple graph-views, as features to represent graphs. Specifically, we derive an evaluation criterion to estimate the discriminative power and the redundancy of sub graph features across all views, and assign proper weight values to each view to indicate its importance for graph classification. The iterative cross graph-view sub graph scoring and graph-view weight updating form a closed loop to find optimal sub graphs to represent graphs for multi-graph-view learning. Experiments and comparisons on real-world tasks demonstrate the algorithm's performance.},
