abstract: "Human mobility prediction is of great importance for various applications such as smart transportation and personalized recommender systems. Although many traditional pattern-based methods and deep models (e.g., recurrent neural networks) based methods have been developed for this task, they essentially do not well cope with the sparsity and inaccuracy of trajectory data and the complicated high-order nature of the sequential dependency, which are typical challenges in mobility prediction. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a novel framework named Graph Convolutional Dual-attentive Networks (GCDAN), which consists of two modules: spatio-temporal embedding and trajectory encoder-decoder. The first module employs a bidirectional diffusion graph convolution to preserve the spatial dependency in the location embedding. The second module employs a dual-attentive mechanism based on a Sequence to Sequence architecture to effectively extract the long-range sequential dependency within a trajectory and the correlation between different trajectories for predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that GCDAN achieves significant performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines."
