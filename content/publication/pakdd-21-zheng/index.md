abstract: "Credit assessment for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is of great interest to financial institutions such as commercial banks and Peer-to-Peer lending platforms. Effective credit rating modeling can help them make loan-granted decisions while limiting their risk exposure. Despite a substantial amount of research being conducted in this domain, there are three existing issues. Firstly, many of them are mainly developed based on financial statements, which usually are not publicly-accessible for SMEs. Secondly, they always neglect the rich relational information embodied in financial networks. Finally, existing graph-neural-network-based (GNN) approaches for credit assessment are only applicable to homogeneous networks. To address these issues, we propose a heterogeneous-attention-network-based model (HAT) to facilitate SMEs bankruptcy prediction using publicly-accessible data. Specifically, our model has two major components: a heterogeneous neighborhood encoding layer and a triple attention output layer. While the first layer can encapsulate target nodesâ€™ heterogeneous neighborhood information to address the graph heterogeneity, the latter can generate the prediction by considering the importance of different metapath-based neighbors, metapaths, and networks. Extensive experiments in a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with baselines."
