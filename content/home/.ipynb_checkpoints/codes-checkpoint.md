## Attributed Network Embedding
#Network embedding has been a hot topic since 2014, which aims to embed each node into a compact and <b> continuous </b> vector space. Our developments include:

#* [<b> TriDNR</b>: Tri-Party Deep Network Representation Learning](../../publication/pan-tri-party-2016/) (IJCAI-16). TriDNR exploits node structure, node content, and node labels (if available) to jointly learn optimal node representation.
# <b>[[Code](https://github.com/shiruipan/TriDNR)]</b>
#* [<b> MGAE</b>: Marginalized Graph Autoencoder for Graph Clustering](../../publication/wang-mgae-2017/) (CIKM-17). MGAE is a stacked graph convolutional autoencoder model to learn latent representation for the graph clustering tasks.  <b>[[Code](https://github.com/FakeTibbers/MGAE)]</b>

## Discrete Network Embedding
#The network embedding is typically represented in continuous vector, which imposes formidable challenges in storage and computation costs, particularly in largescale applications. To address the issue, we propose to learn succinct and <b> discrete </b> node representation for fast node recommendation and classification. Our methods include:

#* [<b> BANE</b>: Binarized Attributed Network Embedding](../../publication/yang-binarized-2018/) (ICDM-18). This is the first discrete network embedding algorithm which exploits both structure and attribute information to learn a binary code for each node in an attribute network.  <b>[[Code](https://github.com/shiruipan/BANE)]</b>

## Graph Neural Networks
#* [<b> Graph WaveNet </b> for Deep Spatial-Temporal Graph Modeling](../../publication/ijcai-2019-wu/) (IJCAI-2019). <b>[[Code](https://github.com/nnzhan/Graph-WaveNet)]</b>
#* [<b> ARGA</b>: Adversarially Regularized Graph Autoencoder for Graph Embedding](../../publication/pan-adversarially-2018/)  (IJCAI-18). ARGA is a novel adversarial graph embedding framework for graph data. <b>[[Code](https://github.com/Ruiqi-Hu/ARGA)]</b> 
#* [<b> GSSNN</b>: Graph Smoothing Splines Neural Networks](../../publication/aaai-2020-zhu/)  (AAAI-20). GSSNN is a novel GNN model for graph classification. <b>[[Code](https://github.com/CheriseZhu/GSSNN)]</b> 

## Heterogeneous Information Networks
#* [<b> RSHN</b>: Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network](../../publication/icdm-19-zhu/)  (ICDM-19). RSHN is a GNN model for heterogeneous information network. <b>[[Code](https://github.com/CheriseZhu/RSHN)]</b> 
#* [<b> MPDRL</b>: Reinforcement Learning for HINs](../../publication/aaai-2020-wan/)  (AAAI-20). MPDRL is a reinforcement learning based method to discover meta-paths from HINs. <b>[[Code](https://github.com/mxz12119/MPDRL)]</b>
